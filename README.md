 HCAHPS Hospital Scores Analysis

## Description
This is a brief and unfinished Mavenanalytics.io project I started working on.  It will serve as a practice space since I have not done Data Science in one year.
What will go here is an analysis of HCAHPS scores from various hospitals across the United States over a 9-year span. This repository contains data processing notebooks, PowerBI visualizations, and machine learning models to provide insights into hospitals' performance and suggest improvements in patient care.
